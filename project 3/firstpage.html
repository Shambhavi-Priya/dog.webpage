        <P>In the wild, a dog is a slender, muscular mammal with
            four long legs and a bushy tail. Dogs are covered with
            fur that is usually a similar color all over its body or
            speckled. They are well-built for hunting, with
            excellent senses to track prey, strong legs for running,
            and sharp teeth for biting. Smaller dogs, such as
            foxes, prey on rodents and birds. Bigger species, such
            as the gray wolf, work in large groups, called packs, to
            hunt mammals as big as deer. Dogs have short, blunt
            claws and hard pads on their feet.</P>
